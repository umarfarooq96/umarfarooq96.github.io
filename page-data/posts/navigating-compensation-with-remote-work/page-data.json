The nature of our work is such that remote work is very frictionless. But, this has given many companies a good question: is permanent remote work possible, feasible or even preferable? In this article I will try to navigate this question and present various arguments and attitudes on this topic.  </p>\n<p>Reiterating the problem statement: should we move to permanent remote work? The first question here should be: why? Here are some reasons which I will propose as questions and then dive deeper into each (ranked from least interesting to most interesting):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is more economical? </li>\n<li>It is more environmental?</li>\n<li>It is more inclusive?</li>\n<li>It is more flexible?</li>\n<li>It is more equitable?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>It is more economical?</h3>\n<p>Economical is obvious. The employer saves money as network infrastructure (VPNs, tech support, remote tooling, etc) is much less expensive than physical infrastructure (offices). The employee will also usually save money on transportation, and the day-to-day expenses with working in an office (appropriate attire, coffees and lunches, etc).</p>\n<h3>It is more environmental?</h3>\n<p>Environmental is obvious, right? No offices and no vehicles for commuting. That should lower the carbon footprint massively. </p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsp.com/en-GB/insights/office-vs-home-working-how-we-can-save-our-carbon-footprint\">Research from WSP UK</a>, a London based consulting firm specialising in engineering, suggests that this is only partially true. Their calculations suggest that in the summer, yes, the net carbon footprint is absolutely lower. But in the winter, the emissions from a single industrial heating system in an office are lower than home heating systems for each employee. Of course, the caveat here is that in the UK, there usually is no need for air conditioning in homes. But if we extend this conclusion to North America, where heating and cooling is needed year round, perhaps working from home is not more environmental at all?</p>\n<p>But this goes further. If we transform our vehicle infrastructure to use electric vehicles rather than ICE vehicles, the carbon footprint of commuting is eliminated regardless. </p>\n<p>And as remote work is global, this goes <em>even</em> further. If an employee lives in the US, which has a 14.7% renewable energy grid, versus Norway, which has a 97.2% renewable energy grid, would heating their home in Norway be a smaller carbon footprint than heating an office in the US? Probably.</p>\n<p>Verdict: We cannot say it is more environmental. At the end of the day, environmental impact is dictated by the energy infrastructure and individual choices.</p>\n<h3>Is it more inclusive?</h3>\n<!---\n**Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique** senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.
