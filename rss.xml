The nature of our work is such that remote work is very frictionless. But, this has given many companies a good question: is permanent remote work possible, feasible or even preferable? In this article I will try to navigate this question and present various arguments and attitudes on this topic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reiterating the problem statement: should we move to permanent remote work? The first question here should be: why? Here are some reasons which I will propose as questions and then dive deeper into each (ranked from least interesting to most interesting):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more economical?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more environmental?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more inclusive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more equitable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It is more economical?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economical is obvious. The employer saves money as network infrastructure (VPNs, tech support, remote tooling, etc) is much less expensive than physical infrastructure (offices). The employee will also usually save money on transportation, and the day-to-day expenses with working in an office (appropriate attire, coffees and lunches, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the economical impact beyond the employer and employee could be a negative. City centres and businesses who rely on nearby workers (i.e, a food truck relying on workers grabbing a quick lunch) may end up hurting. But such is the nature of our economy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction&quot;&gt;creative destruction&lt;/a&gt;. And previous doomsday predictions of urban centres have usually not materialized.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: It is very likely more economical.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It is more environmental?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental is obvious, right? No offices and no vehicles for commuting. That should lower the carbon footprint massively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsp.com/en-GB/insights/office-vs-home-working-how-we-can-save-our-carbon-footprint&quot;&gt;Research from WSP UK&lt;/a&gt;, a London based consulting firm specialising in engineering, suggests that this is only partially true. Their calculations suggest that in the summer, yes, the net carbon footprint is absolutely lower. But in the winter, the emissions from a single industrial heating system in an office are lower than home heating systems for each employee. Of course, the caveat here is that in the UK, there usually is no need for air conditioning in homes. But if we extend this conclusion to North America, where heating and cooling is needed year round, perhaps working from home is not more environmental at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this goes further. If we transform our vehicle infrastructure to use electric vehicles rather than ICE vehicles, the carbon footprint of commuting is eliminated regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as remote work is global, this goes &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; further. If an employee lives in the US, which has a 14.7% renewable energy grid, versus Norway, which has a 97.2% renewable energy grid, would heating their home in Norway be a smaller carbon footprint than heating an office in the US? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: We cannot say it is more environmental. At the end of the day, environmental impact is dictated by the energy infrastructure and individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is it more inclusive?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inclusive is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, there is the obvious analysis. Work from home affords more flexibility; flexibility is usually more inclusive. For example, caregivers, particularly with young children, may find working from home a lot more palatable. A stay at home father who needs to pickup and drop a kid in school will face challenges if they are in the office. With work from home, this becomes a lot less of a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, isolation can lead to less interaction between diverse people. Naturally, if given the choice, one will favour people who are similar to them. And the minority group can often feel isolated in this environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious example of this is a workplace with rabid hockey fans ignoring a worker who does not watch sports, let alone hockey. Or a group of French Canadian workers speaking French and excluding a monolingual employee. Although this may be exaggerated in a remote work environment, there is no reason it cannot happen in person. A more pressing issue may be one brought up by Kent Beck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer-term thing I’m concerned about is career growth for juniors. There’s so much value in that lunch-room conversation that a junior begins by sitting in on and gradually becomes a confident contributor to. How’s that going to happen in a remote world? That worries me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/kent-beck-geeks-gusto-globalization&quot;&gt;Kent Beck, August 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, lunch-room conversations have been extremely beneficial to career growth. After a meeting about high level design, a junior dev can, understandably, be lost. Talking this over with a teammate when going for coffee has been instrumental to me becoming a more valuable contributor in future meetings. Likewise, topics that are more general or large scale aren’t brought up in scheduled meetings, they’re brought up in offhand discussions. For example, a senior engineering venting about the direction a high level project is going can be valuable to a junior engineer, but rarely you’ll see a meeting invite for “rants about management choices”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these are growing pains with remote work. It is up to workplace culture to cultivate these types of interactions — perhaps through lunch and learns, dedicated retro meetings, mentorship programs, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: there are detriments which can be solved and worked on but inclusivity and diversity benefits exclusive to remote work (no pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It is more equitable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what does equitable mean? And why did I choose “equitable” instead of “equal”? The classic explanation goes like this: equitable is that everyone wears shoes that fits their feet, equal is that everyone gets a size 9 shoe. Our goal as a society (in most scenarios) to be equitable, not equal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we decide what is equitable with respect to remote work? In my eyes, there are two key considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compensation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is employment opportunity. With remote work, the opportunity playing field is leveled across all candidates. A skilled engineer from Peru no longer has to jump through hoops to be employed by a company based in Toronto. Although the privileges of being from Toronto rather than a South American country may still exist, the basis of employment will now solely (ideally solely, realistically mostly) be based on merit. To me, this is more equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting though is compensation. Peru is one of the least expensive countries in South America to live in. The average rent for a 1 bedroom in a city centre in Peru is $539, whereas in Canada it is $1341 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Canada&amp;#x26;country2=Peru&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). So does equitable mean an employee in Peru should be paid 60% less than an employee in Canada?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, let’s see what is compensation. Or better yet, why do people work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the meaning and purpose it provides, plus the communal benefits of labour, mostly we work for compensation. You trade your labour for money. From this follows that the same labour should be given the same compensation. If I make $15/hr doing a job in Toronto, I should also make $15/hr for that job if I live in Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this correct? Is it more correct to say you trade your labour for money which you trade for food, shelter, clothes, etc? Or more generally, you trade your labour for money which you trade for a certain quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is the more interesting perspective. You see, a particular job is often rewarded with a particular quality of live. A doctor in Toronto makes enough money to live without worrying about going hungry or retiring poor. Likewise, a doctor in Ghana probably has a similar quality of life. And on the other end, a dish washer in a resturant in Toronto probably struggles to afford rent just as a dish washer in Egypt probably struggles to afford rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, job seekers already take this into account. Go into any forum discussing engineering salaries and you’ll find the debates about 100k in HCOL (high cost of living) versus 60k in LCOL (low cost of living), despite both jobs usually being comparable in terms of the work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict: remote work is more equitable opportunity wise, it is debatable if it is more equitable compensation wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Verdict of verdicts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, remote work has very tangible benefits. And permnanent remote work really can bring benefits to workers which simply cannot be had without. But there are very real detriments to remote work and lingering questions regarding what is fair or equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until those are hashed out, I think the best medium for now is a free choice policy. If you want to work from home, feel free to. For anything that can be justified to be in person, the conversation should be had individually. And for folks who like working at work, that choice should also exist.&lt;/p&gt;
